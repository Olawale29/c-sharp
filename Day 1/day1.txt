Today I learned what C# is — an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# is versatile and widely used for building mobile apps, web apps, desktop software, games, VR experiences, and more.

It’s easy to learn, has a strong community, and shares similarities with C, C++, and Java, making it beginner-friendly yet powerful.

Excited to dive deeper into C# in the coming days!
